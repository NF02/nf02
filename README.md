#### What do I do?
Basically I deal with Unix and Unix-Like systems, mostly Linux, currently I have published some forks including dwm, st and dmenu. I have written a front-end for Wacom graphics tablets based on dmenu, I am creating extensions and plugins for Vim text editor (now I use GNU/Emacs) and also other secondary projects.

##### What do I think about the UNIX philosophy?
The UNIX philosophy has always fascinated me, in fact, I have been in this world for a lifetime and I have had the opportunity to denote the strengths and weaknesses of the aforementioned models, in the merits we can find the idea of wanting to do simple things, on the other hand we find that reality being complex needs equally complex solutions, especially thinking of modern devices that have infinitely superior hardware capabilities compared to those present in the 70s when this philosophy had the This was one of the reasons that led MIT Bell Labs to create Plan9 in the 90s, which by its nature solves all the problems of the previous model, defining new standards (which unfortunately have never spread) including the Kernel Hack for graphics, which allowed to be able to generate GUI interfaces in the most practical and streamlined way. These are the reasons that led me to study and analyze these systems and to have a comparison and therefore to be able to evaluate.

For the reasons mentioned above, I typically take non-POSIX changes made within Linux systems with a good eye or neutrality to try to rejuvenate and solve problems that would otherwise be very difficult in today's world, made up of a multitude of services to manage and hardware that know how to parallelize even too well.
